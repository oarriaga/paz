    Stacks of (1 x 1)-(3 x 3)-(1 x 1) BN-ReLU-Conv2D or also known as
    bottleneck layer
    First shortcut connection per layer is 1 x 1 Conv2D.
    Second and onwards shortcut connection is identity.
    At the beginning of each stage, the feature map size is halved
    (downsampled) by a convolutional layer with strides=2, while
    the number of filter maps is doubled. Within each stage, the layers
    have the same number filters and the same filter map sizes.
    Features maps sizes:
    conv1  : 32x32,  16
    stage 0: 32x32,  64
    stage 1: 16x16, 128
    stage 2:  8x8,  256

        input_shape (tensor): shape of input image tensor
